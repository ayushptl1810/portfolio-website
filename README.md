## 💡 About Me

I'm a helpful, reliable teammate who focuses on getting things done. When I'm not coding, you'll find me watching football (Manchester United fan), gaming, or listening to music. I believe in continuous learning and pushing the boundaries of what's possible on the web.

_Always open to collaboration and new opportunities._
