Hello, my name is Ayush Patel. I have lived in Mumbai my entire life, but my ancestral home is Gujarat. As you have already seen on my portfolio, yes I am doing dual degree, BS in Datascience from IIT Madras which is an online degree and BTech in Computer Science and Engineering (Datascience) from DJ Sanghvi in Mumbai. I am a single child. I will graduate from DJ Sanghvi in June 2027, although since IIT Madras course is actually quite flexible and vast, there is a good probability that it may take till early 2028 or late 2027 for me to complete it.

The 3 things I love the most is Football, Gaming and Music.

I have played football since I was 10, I actually joined a football coaching and was trained as a goalkeeper. Recently, after Covid hit, I stopped playing because I could not regain my fitness levels.

My favourite football club is Manchester United. I started watching football since 2017, the very first match I ever watched was the Europa League final between Manchester United and Ajax, and I fell in love with the club.

I also read up on the history of the club, their recent success, disasters and everything which made me love the club even more, and even after almost 10 yrs, I still stay up late to watch the matches and hope for club glory. This game at times can be very unpredictable, anything can happen in a matter of minutes that can change the tide of entire seasons at times. My favourite Manchester United match that I watched was the night in Paris when Manchester United went up against Paris Saint German, trailing by 2 goals in the first leg of Champions League R016, and manage to win 3-1 to tie up on goals and win on the basis of away goals, but the Europa League Semi Final in 24/25 season against Lyon was also one of favourites ever. Remember when I said that few mins can change the tide of entire seasons at times? Well the 24/25 was one of the worst seasons in recent times, and Europa League was the only thing going on for Manchester United. United went up 2 goals in the second leg but Lyon equalised before the 90 min mark to put the game into extra time where they scored 2 more goals. By the 114th min, United were destined to lose 4-2 and crash out of the Europa League, but they managed to somehow get in 3 past Lyon in the final few mins to win the game 5-4. These are the momments that make me love the game so much, so many ups and downs.

I also love gaming, I started playing mobile games on my dad's phone like any other kid. I used to play games like clash of clans, subway surfers etc. But I actually fell in love when I got my first console.

I got my first console when I was in 8th grade which was a PS4 Slim. Only thing I used to look upto every week was getting to play games on it every weekend. Very recently I upgraded to PS5 Slim Disk which was a totally different experience.

I used to play FPS games a lot until recently when I have started playing RPG games. My favourite ever game was Wukong, the action sequence, the cinematic experience and the story telling was top notch. God of War comes in close second followed by Ghost of Tsushima to round up my top 3 favourite games.

And finally music, how can I forget it. Music is literally the only thing that helps me survive each day. I listen to music while, while travelling to college or anywhere through traffic, sometimes also during lectures just to make it bearable. Music gives me a sense of calmness that I can't get anywhere else.

My favourite genre is Pop. My favourite song is "Those Eyes" by New West and my favourite artist are the Chainsmokers. Each year, I listen to songs about 20 to 40k mins on Spotify.

My plan for future is to continue my love for gaming, but instead of taking a route along streaming or content creation, I want to build games. Not because I hate it or do not want to work for it, but rather that it is just not who I am.

This is why I plan to go for higher studies in the gaming industry, work alongside people who share the same love I have for gaming.

I also want to travel. A lot. I want to see the world, the beauty in it. Aside from music, looking over beautiful scenery, mountains, valleys, it brings a type of peace that is very addicting to me.

Now you might be wondering what kind of person I am, well I am like. I try to be a helpful person, always ready to help, ready to explain or clear doubts and concepts. And if someone gives me some task or work, I always try my best to complete it. I am not a very vocal person, I am like that guy who comes in, silently puts in good work and leaves at the end of the day, no ego, no fighting, just getting shit done.

I am also as determined by my friends, "chronically online", mainly because whenever I get messaged, I almost instantly reply back. I am also not a stranger to pulling in all nighters to get shit done if needed.

One of my major factors to choose Engineering over Medical was because of my passion for gaming, I knew early on what I wanted to do with game development, and starting Web Development was an easy choice for me since web development is also focused on good designs and animations. To be honest, I tried App Development once, tried to create a login form basic frontend on flutter and never took it up again. Partly because I realised how hard it is but majorly because I did not enjoy doing that, but when I tried web developement, I actually did enjoy a lot designing uis and the satisfaction after completing one page was made it even better.
