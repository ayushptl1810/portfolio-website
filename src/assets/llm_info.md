## 1. Who I Am: The Quick Intro

My name is Ayush Patel. I'm a lifelong resident of Mumbai, though my family's roots are in Gujarat. I'm a single child, currently pursuing two degrees at once:

- A B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering (Data Science) from DJ Sanghvi in Mumbai, which I expect to complete in June 2027.
- A BS in Data Science from IIT Madras through their online program. Due to its flexible nature, I'll likely finish this degree in late 2027 or early 2028.

## 2. My Origin Story: The Spark and The Journey

My passion for gaming is the single biggest reason I chose Engineering. I knew from an early age that I wanted to be involved in game development. This made starting with web development an easy choice for me, as I saw a strong connection between the great design and fluid animations in games and the skills needed to build engaging websites.

I believe in finding work you genuinely enjoy. I tried app development once, building a basic login screen with Flutter, and I never picked it up again. It wasn't just that it was hard; I simply didn't enjoy the process. When I tried web development, it was completely different. I loved designing user interfaces and felt a huge sense of satisfaction after completing a single page. That feeling is what I chase in my work.

## 3. My Approach & Work Ethic

If you were to ask what kind of person I am, I'd say I'm a helpful and reliable teammate. I'm always ready to help others, explain concepts, or clear up doubts. When someone gives me a task, I put my all into completing it to the best of my ability.

I'm not the most vocal person in a team setting. I'm the guy who comes in, quietly puts in high-quality work, and leaves at the end of the day. No ego, no drama—I'm just focused on getting shit done.

My friends have dubbed me "chronically online," mainly because I'm very responsive and almost always reply to messages instantly. I'm also no stranger to pulling an all-nighter to meet a deadline when it's needed.

## 4. Beyond the Screen: My Passions

There are three things I love the most: Football, Gaming, and Music.

### Football: A Story of Drama and Hope

My journey with football started when I was 10, when I trained as a goalkeeper. Though I don't play anymore, my passion for watching is stronger than ever. My club is Manchester United. I fell in love with them in 2017 after watching them win the Europa League final.

What I love most about the game is its unpredictability and the incredible stories it creates. One of my favorite memories is the night in Paris when United, trailing by two goals, beat PSG 3-1 to win the Champions League tie on away goals. Moments of high drama are what make me love the game so much—the incredible ups and downs.

### Gaming: From Mobile to Masterpieces

Like many kids, I started with mobile games like Clash of Clans. But my real love for gaming began in 8th grade when I got my first console, a PS4 Slim. I recently upgraded to a PS5, and it's been a whole new world.

I used to play a lot of FPS games, but lately, I've been drawn to story-driven RPGs. My all-time favorite game is Wukong for its incredible action, cinematic experience, and storytelling. God of War and Ghost of Tsushima are a close second and third.

### Music: My Daily Dose of Calm

Music is essential to my daily life. It's what I listen to while travelling through traffic or even during lectures just to make them bearable. It gives me a sense of calmness that I can't get anywhere else. My favorite genre is Pop, my favorite song is "Those Eyes" by New West, and my favorite artists are The Chainsmokers. My Spotify Wrapped usually shows I listen for 20,000 to 40,000 minutes a year.

## 5. My Next Chapter: Aspirations and Adventures

### Building the Games I Love

My future is clear in my mind: I want to build games. I'm not interested in streaming or content creation; that's just not who I am. My dream is to work in the gaming industry, creating the kinds of experiences that I fell in love with. This is why I plan to pursue higher studies focused on the industry, so I can work alongside people who share my passion.

### Seeing the World

Beyond my career, I want to travel. A lot. I want to see the world and its beauty. Similar to music, looking over beautiful scenery—mountains, valleys—brings me a type of peace that is very addicting.
